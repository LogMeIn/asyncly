# Contributing to Asyncly on GitHub

We gladly take pull requests on GitHub. Please follow these guidelines to make
it easier for us to merge your pull requests:

1. make sure to clang-format your changes
2. although we lack a formal coding style guide, please make sure to follow the
   conventions of the code around your change.
3. after you opened a PR, it will be reviewed by asyncly maintainers. After all
   review feedback has been incorporated, we will merge the patch to LogMeIns
   internal version of asyncly and it will arrive in GitHub soon after. This is
   necessary because we want to run our internal integration test suite against
   the change to make sure it doesn't break any production services.
